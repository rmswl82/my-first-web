</p><p style="margin-top:20px;">It’s also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality, although it is now considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates. This article will go over the basics of HTML, including how it works, its pros and cons, and how it relates to CSS and JavaScript.</p>
